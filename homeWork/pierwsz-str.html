            <p>The a, or Assyrian genocide, was the mass slaughter and deportation of Assyrian and Syriac Christians in
                southeastern Anatolia and Persia's Azerbaijan province committed by Ottoman forces and Kurdish tribes
                during
                World War I. The Assyrians lived in mountainous and remote areas and were divided into several mutually
                antagonistic churches. Mass killing of Assyrian civilians began in <i>January 1915,</i> by the Ottoman
                military
                and
                pro-Ottoman Kurds. Attacks on, massacres of and deportations of Christian populations continued until
                1919,
                usually facing only sporadic armed resistance. Ottoman Assyrians living in present-day Iraq and Syria
                were
                not targeted. The Sayfo occurred concurrently with and was closely related to the Armenian genocide.
                Motives
                included a perceived lack of loyalty among some Assyrian communities to the Ottoman Empire and a desire
                to
                appropriate their land. In 1919 the Assyrians said that roughly 250,000 were killed in the genocide,
                about
                half the pre-war population. (Full article...) The Sayfo, or Assyrian genocide, was the mass slaughter
